<p>In this document, we briefly describe the used libraries, the authors of the code, and source files in this
repository. To see a detailed description of each file&#39;s classes, methods, functions etc.,
we refer the reader to the individual .html files in this directory.</p>
<h2 id="utilized-libraries"><a class="header-link" href="#utilized-libraries"></a>Utilized libraries</h2>
<p>The code in this repository is based on the following two fundamental libraries:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><a href="https://github.com/sinzlab/neuralpredictors">neuralpredictors</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/lucabaroni/predict_neural_responses">predict_neural_responses</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="predict_neural_responses"><a class="header-link" href="#predict_neural_responses"></a>predict_neural_responses</h3>
<p><strong>predict_neural_responses</strong> is <strong>Luca Baroni</strong>&#39;s repository. I have also some minor
contribution to this library. <strong>I forked predict_neural_responses and added this fork into this
repository as a subrepository.</strong> As a consequence, it is clear that the original author and the
owner of the code is Luca Baroni.</p>
<p>The foremost purpose of this library is to give some shared structure in our lab to the ML models for neural response prediction
and, as a consequence, have the models more easily reusable by other colleagues.
It is primarily accomplished by the class <code>encoding_model</code> in the <code>models.py</code> module.
We extended this library in <code>models.py</code> (file in reCNN_visual_prosthesis repository!)
and created a class <code>ExtendedEncodingModel</code> from which all our models inherit.</p>
<h3 id="neuralpredictors"><a class="header-link" href="#neuralpredictors"></a>Neuralpredictors</h3>
<p>This library is mostly imported as a regular Python module by our scripts.</p>
<p>However, we also copied some pieces of this library and extended them for our
purposes. To be concrete, the following files reuse some code from Neuralpredictors:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><a href="Lurz_dataset.html">Lurz_dataset.py</a> - This is a reimplementation of Lurz&#39;s dataset that can be used with newer versions of Neuralpredictors library.
Moreover, it implements Pytorch Lightning LightningDataModule so that we can handle it more conveniently.</li>
<li><a href="core.html">core.py</a> - we copied class <code>RotationEquivariant2dCore</code> from <code>layers/cores/conv2d.py</code> located in Neuralpredictors. Then we modified
it for our purposes.</li>
<li><a href="readout.html">readout.py</a> - similarly to <a href="core.html">core.py</a>, <a href="readout.html">readout.py</a> contains a class <code>Gaussian3dCyclic</code> 
that was made from <code>Gaussian3d</code> class in <code>layers/readouts/gaussian.py</code> from Neuralpredictors. It was extended and modified
for the purposes of our work.</li>
</ul>
<p>In all three files it is usually very clear what functions were added/edited/not changed.
However, it is always possible to use <code>diff</code> with the original Neuralpredictors library..</p>
<h3 id="description-of-other-folders"><a class="header-link" href="#description-of-other-folders"></a>Description of other folders</h3>
<h2 id="metacentrum"><a class="header-link" href="#metacentrum"></a><code>metacentrum/</code></h2>
<p>This folder contains scripts and configs for deployment of the models onto the MetaCentrum servers.</p>
<h2 id="experiments"><a class="header-link" href="#experiments"></a><code>experiments/</code></h2>
<p>In this folder, there are two files providing the experiments that were done
with the trained networks. Moreover, it can generate multiple interesting
figures that were subsequently used in the thesis. Just run <code>python experiments/experiments.py</code>.</p>
<h2 id="imgs"><a class="header-link" href="#imgs"></a><code>imgs/</code></h2>
<p>Contains generated images. Most of them were used in the thesis.</p>
<h2 id="sandbox"><a class="header-link" href="#sandbox"></a><code>sandbox/</code></h2>
<p>Consists of older experiments and tests that were believed to be important for archivation.
Do not use this repository, it is just for the development. Nothing interesting here.</p>
<h2 id="sweep_configs"><a class="header-link" href="#sweep_configs"></a><code>sweep_configs/</code></h2>
<p>A folder with multiple configuration files that were used for wandb sweeps.</p>
<h2 id="description-of-files-in-the-root-directory-of-this-repository"><a class="header-link" href="#description-of-files-in-the-root-directory-of-this-repository"></a>Description of files in the root directory of this repository</h2>
<p><a href="Antolik_dataset.html">Antolik_dataset.py</a> and <a href="Lurz_dataset.html">Lurz_dataset.py</a> contain classes for work with datasets.</p>
<p><a href="core.html">core.py</a>, <a href="readout.html">readout.py</a> contain the developed core and readout.</p>
<p><a href="model_trainer.html">model_trainer.py</a> is a file with a purpose of preparing the datasets and 
setting up a training of a given model with a connection to Wandb.</p>
<p><a href="models.html">models.py</a> contains developed models including the most important one: <code>reCNN_bottleneck_CyclicGauss3d</code></p>
<p><a href="present_best_models.html">present_best_models.py</a> is a file that is supposed to run an evaluation on the best
models and print the obtained results.</p>
<p>Files <a href="train_on_lurz.html">train_on_lurz.py</a> , <a href="train_on_antolik.html">train_on_antolik.py</a> are files that are used to setup a training
of our model on Lurz&#39;s or Antolik&#39;s data.</p>
<p>Files <a href="train_control_model_on_lurz_dataset.html">train_control_model_on_lurz_dataset.py</a>, <a href="train_control_model_on_antolik_dataset.html">train_control_model_on_antolik_dataset.py</a> setup training
of the control model on Lurz&#39;s and Antolik&#39;s dataset.</p>
<p><a href="train_antolik_test.html">train_antolik_test.py</a> trains only on Antolik&#39;s test set.</p>
<p><a href="utils.html">utils.py</a> provides utilities that can be used in the code.</p>
<p><a href="create_ensemble.html">create_ensemble.py</a> is a file that aggregates multiple models and creates an ensemble.</p>
